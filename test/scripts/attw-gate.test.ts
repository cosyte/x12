/**
 * Tests for scripts/attw.mjs, the wrapper that makes the `attw` publish gate
 * able to report its own failure.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN, AND WHY EACH ONE IS HERE:
 *
 *  1. THE UPSTREAM BEHAVIOUR THE WRAPPER EXISTS FOR. `attw` prints "This package
 *     does not contain types." and exits 0. If a future `attw` upgrade fixes that
 *     exit code or rewords the sentence, this test reds, which is the point. A
 *     guard that silently stops matching is worse than no guard, and the
 *     post-check in `attw.mjs` is the one net that depends on a string.
 *  2. That the wrapper turns that exit 0 into a failure.
 *  3. That the preflight catches a declared-but-missing artifact. That is the
 *     shape a `dist/` removed, or not yet written, underneath the gate takes, and
 *     it reproduces on this package with no concurrency at all.
 *  4. A NEGATIVE CONTROL. On a package whose tarball really does carry types the
 *     wrapper is transparent: the same exit status as `attw` itself, and green. A
 *     gate that only ever fails is not a gate, and a false red here would cost
 *     every later run an hour.
 *  5. THE GATE'S MOST BASIC OBLIGATION, that a real `attw` failure still fails.
 *     Without this, every other test here would pass on a wrapper that swallowed
 *     attw's own exit status, because the post-check reds the untyped fixture
 *     regardless.
 *  6. The refusals that keep the post-check readable. Each argument and config
 *     route here was measured against this repo's own `attw` binary to make the
 *     untyped sentence unreadable while handing back exit 0, which is the exact
 *     false green this file exists to close.
 *
 * The fixtures are minimal throwaway packages in a temp dir. Nothing here touches
 * this repo's own build, so the suite neither needs one nor can race one. `attw`
 * is invoked with `--no-definitely-typed` so the runs stay offline, which works
 * because the wrapper forwards arguments it does not refuse.
 *
 * Every subprocess call uses spawnSync with array args. No exec, no shell form.
 * Each spawn carries its own timeout, so a hung child fails this suite instead of
 * wedging it.
