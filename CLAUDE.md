# @cosyte/x12 — Project Guide for Claude

## Project

**`@cosyte/x12`** — a developer-focused ASC X12 EDI parser + utility library for Node.js/TypeScript, published under the Cosyte brand. Open-source (MIT). The payer-side sibling of [`@cosyte/hl7`](../hl7) — API shape, profile system, and lenient-parser philosophy are deliberately mirrored.

**North star:** A developer can parse a real-world, vendor-quirky X12 healthcare interchange and pull useful fields out of it in one line — without having read the X12 standard or any TR3 implementation guide.

## Status

- **Early scaffold.** Only the `src/index.ts` `VERSION` sentinel + a sanity test exist; the parser,
  envelope, transaction, and helper modules in the v1 scope below are not built yet.
- On the shared cosyte engineering standard (migrated Phase E) — toolchain inherited from the
  published `@cosyte/*` config packages, CI/release are thin callers of `cosyte/.github`.
- Pre-alpha `0.0.x`, not published to npm.

## v1 Scope Snapshot

HIPAA healthcare transaction sets at version **005010** (with errata hooks for `005010X279A1`, `005010X221A1`, etc.):

- **270 / 271** Eligibility Inquiry / Response
- **276 / 277** Claim Status Inquiry / Response (incl. 277CA)
- **278** Services Review (Request + Response)
- **820** Premium Payment
- **834** Benefit Enrollment & Maintenance
- **835** Healthcare Claim Payment/Advice (ERA)
- **837P / 837I / 837D** Professional / Institutional / Dental Claims
- **999** Implementation Acknowledgment (parse + build)
- **TA1** Interchange Acknowledgment (parse + build)

Non-healthcare (850/856/810/204), EDIFACT, AS2/SFTP transport, and pre-005010 are out of v1 scope.

## Tech Stack (the shared `@cosyte/*` standard)

x12 mirrors `@cosyte/hl7` (the reference parser) and inherits the canonical toolchain by depending on
the published `@cosyte/*` config packages, not by copying files. The source of truth is the meta-repo's
`documentation/conventions.md` — this is a summary.

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict, full rigor set incl. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) via
  `@cosyte/tsconfig`. **Target ES2023**. The shared base sets `verbatimModuleSyntax: false`.
- **Build:** dual ESM + CJS + `.d.ts` via `tsup` (`@cosyte/tsup-config`); `attw` is a publish gate
  (per-condition types: `.d.ts` for `import`, `.d.cts` for `require`).
- **Node:** **>= 22** (CI matrix 22 + 24, via the reusable pipeline).
- **Package manager:** `pnpm@10`.
- **Lint/format:** **ESLint 10** + unified `typescript-eslint` (type-checked) via
  `@cosyte/eslint-config`; Prettier via `@cosyte/prettier-config`. Lint at `--max-warnings=0`.
- **Testing:** **Vitest 4** + v8 coverage (`@cosyte/vitest-config`), per-directory >= 90 gates
  (armed globally now; per-dir gates get listed in `vitest.config.ts` once parser code lands).
- **CI/CD:** thin callers of the reusable `cosyte/.github` workflows.
- **Runtime deps:** **Zero.** Node stdlib only.
- **License:** MIT

## Engineering Guardrails

- No `any`. No unjustified `as` casts. Use `unknown` and narrow.
- JSDoc (with `@example`) on every public export — feeds IntelliSense.
- Immutable by default. Mutation only via explicit methods (`setElement`, `addSegment`, `addLoopIteration`, `removeSegment`).
- No `console.*` in library code. Throw typed errors or return results.
- Short, testable functions over big parsing blobs.
- Postel's Law: parser is liberal (lenient default + warnings with stable codes and positional context); serializer is conservative (always emits spec-clean X12 with recomputed envelope counts where requested).
- Fatal errors only for unrecoverable structural corruption (4 Tier-3 codes: `X12_NO_ISA_HEADER`, `X12_ISA_TOO_SHORT`, `X12_INVALID_DELIMITERS`, `X12_EMPTY_INPUT`). Everything else is a warning.
- Coverage target: ≥ 90% on `src/parser/`, `src/envelope/`, `src/transactions/`, `src/helpers/`.
- Built-in loop specs + profiles must be authored through the same public API (`defineLoopSpec()`, `defineProfile()`) — dogfooding gate.
- HIPAA code lists ship as versioned data snapshots. Code-list updates are a release event, not a runtime fetch. `codeLists.meta.snapshotDate` is the runtime surface for snapshot-freshness checks.
- Acknowledgments (`build999`, `buildTA1`, `parse999`) are pure functions — they never auto-send, never open sockets, never touch the filesystem.

## Sibling Project

**`@cosyte/hl7`** lives at `../hl7` and ships a matching API shape for HL7 v2. When in doubt on an API decision, check how `@cosyte/hl7` solved it — symmetry is a feature, not an accident.

## Standing disciplines (every change)

These three bind every change in this repo (mirrored from the cosyte meta-repo's
`documentation/conventions.md`):

1. **Documentation follows code.** A public-surface / stack / status change isn't done until its
   docs are: this package's own docs (`docs-content/` + JSDoc), and — in the meta-repo — its
   `documentation/repos/<repo>.md` and the `ecosystem-map.md` status table.
2. **Version + changelog every meaningful change.** Add a Changeset (`pnpm changeset`, `patch`
   during pre-alpha) and keep `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` current. Stay on `0.0.x` until first alpha.
3. **Crew + knowledgebase feedback loop.** When a standard, decision, or public surface changes,
   flag whether a `crew` skill or `knowledgebase` doc needs creating/updating — never silently skip.

Build, lint, format, and TypeScript settings come from the shared `@cosyte/*` config packages
(`@cosyte/tsconfig` · `@cosyte/eslint-config` · `@cosyte/prettier-config`; see
`documentation/conventions.md` → "Canonical toolchain (enforced)"). Node ≥ 22.
