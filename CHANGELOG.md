# Changelog

All notable changes to `@cosyte/x12` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial repo scaffolding: package metadata, dual ESM + CJS build via `tsup`,
  strict TypeScript, type-checked ESLint with a JSDoc/`@example` gate on public
  exports, Prettier, and Vitest.

### Changed

- Migrated onto the shared cosyte engineering standard (Phase E). The toolchain
  is now inherited from the published `@cosyte/*` config packages instead of
  per-repo copies: `tsup.config.ts` uses `cosyteTsup`, `vitest.config.ts` uses
  `cosyteVitest`, and `eslint.config.js` is the three-line `cosyte` wrapper.
  Bumped to ESLint 10, Vitest 4 (+ `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4), Vite 7, and
  `@types/node` 22; added `@arethetypeswrong/cli` with an `attw --pack .` gate
  wired into `prepublishOnly`. CI and release are now thin callers of the
  reusable `cosyte/.github` workflows (the shared pipeline runs the Node 22 + 24
  matrix). The shared `@cosyte/tsconfig` base sets `verbatimModuleSyntax: false`.
- Removed `.github/dependabot.yml`; org-wide dependency updates will be handled
  by Renovate when it is rolled out.
